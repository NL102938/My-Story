**Story**
Once upon a time, in a Forest there lived a Monkey who resided on a Berry Tree which was on the banks of a river.
In the same Forest there lived a Crocodile and his wife. One day the Crocodile came to the bank of the river and
rested under the tree. The kind hearted Monkey offered him some fruits. The Crocodile came back the next day for
more fruits. As he loved them and the day passed, the Crocodile and the Monkey became good friends.
